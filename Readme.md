# Medical Chatbot Agent - using Langchain

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Custom Agent Medical Chatbot with Streamlit UI!

LangChain Custom Agent Chatbot with Streamlit UI 


## Features
- **Website Interaction**: The chatbot uses the latest version of LangChain to interact with and extract information from various websites, providing insightful responses.
- **Large Language Model Integration**: Compatibility with models like GPT-4, Mistral, Llama2, and ollama. In this code I am using GPT-4, but you have the flexibility to switch to any other supported model.
- **Streamlit GUI**: A clean and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
